# COVERTRACE-SAT

I’m sharing my new paper, “COVERTRACE-SAT as Disjoint-Subcube Knowledge Compilation.” It reframes CNF-SAT/#SAT geometrically: clauses forbid axis-aligned subcubes of the Boolean hypercube, and we maintain an exact disjoint cover (DSOP-style) so model counting becomes additive and witness extraction is constructive. The paper formalizes correctness, analyzes fragmentation as the central complexity driver, proves explicit exponential worst-case lower bounds for disjoint subcube covers, and discusses the conditional consequence that uniform polynomial-size disjoint-cover compilation would imply #SAT ∈ P and collapse PH. Code is included for reproducibility and benchmarking.
