# COVERTRACE-SAT

This work positions COVERTRACE-SAT within the knowledge compilation landscape: compiling the forbidden region of a CNF into a disjoint union of subcubes (a DSOP-like object) yields exact #SAT via volume additivity and enables fast survival queries for constructive models. I provide a rigorous formulation, relate the representation to classical compilation targets, and prove a tight exponential lower bound on the size of any disjoint subcube cover for explicit families (fragmentation barrier). I also discuss implications for proof complexity and conditional complexity-theoretic consequences (e.g., PH collapse under polynomial-size uniform compilation).
